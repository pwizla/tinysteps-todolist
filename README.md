A minimalist, flat-like, work-in-progress todolist web app created by a newbie. 

## About tinysteps

I started to learn to code in July 2015, and these are my baby steps.

Thanks FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy for offering such great content for free! 
Completing the various exercises and challenges offered by these e-learning tools is not enough for me, though. I want to learn by _creating_ things on my own, from scratch.    

So each of the **tinysteps** projects are little web apps that I create for my personal use, just for the fun of practicing. These "tiny" apps are probably buggy, not perfect, incomplete, but it's a constant work in progress. If you're an experienced web developer, you will probably not find any interesting stuff here. But if, like me, you're new to the world of coding, are willing to learn a lot, and don't fear spending more times fixing bugs rather than using the apps, feel free to use my code and build upon it to create great things, and let's make a way together on the long path to becoming a so-called developer! :-)
