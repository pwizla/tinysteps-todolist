## About tinysteps

I started to learn to code in July 2015. 
Thanks FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy for offering such great content for free! 
Completing the various exercises and challenges offered by these e-learning tools is not enough for me, though. I want to learn by _creating_ things on my own, from scratch.    
So each of the **tinysteps** projects are little web apps that I create for my personal use, just for the fun of practicing. These "tiny" apps are probably buggy, not perfect, incomplete, but it's a constant work in progress. If you're an experienced web developer, you will probably not find any interesting stuff here. But if, like me, you're a newbie, willing to learn, feel free to use my code and build upon it to make great things, and let's make a way together on the long path to becoming a so-called developer! :-)
